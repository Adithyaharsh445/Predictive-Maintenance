Predictive Maintenance Using Machine Learning
Project Overview
In the industrial and manufacturing sectors, unexpected machine failures can disrupt production and increase operational costs. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict potential machine failures before they happen, helping industries optimize maintenance schedules, minimize downtime, and reduce maintenance costs. By leveraging sensor and operational data, we can effectively predict failures and enable proactive, data-driven maintenance strategies.

Getting Started
Data Preprocessing
We performed several preprocessing steps to ensure data quality and consistency:

Missing Values: No missing values were present in the dataset.
Outlier Detection and Handling:
Outliers in Rotational Speed and Torque were identified using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Log transformation was applied to reduce the impact of extreme values.
Scaling:
Standardization was applied to numerical features (air temperature, process temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear) to ensure uniformity.
Encoding:
Categorical features, such as Type, were transformed using One-Hot Encoding to allow for numerical model inputs.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Our analysis of the dataset revealed key patterns and correlations:

Product Quality Distribution:
60% of the products in the dataset are of low quality, which correlates with a higher likelihood of machine failure.
Failures are significantly less common in high-quality products.
Feature Correlations:
A strong positive correlation was observed between Air Temperature and Process Temperature, suggesting that the machine’s thermal dynamics affect both.
Rotational Speed and Torque have a strong inverse correlation, indicating their interdependence in maintaining power output.
Feature Engineering
To enhance model performance, we created the following engineered features:

Mechanical Power: Defined as the product of rotational speed and torque, capturing machine output.
Temperature Difference: Calculated as the difference between process temperature and air temperature to highlight potential overheating risks.
Log transformation was applied to these new features for stability and improved model fit.
Model Selection and Training
We trained several machine learning models to identify the optimal approach for predicting machine failures:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
XGBoost
AdaBoost
Logistic Regression
Training Process
Train/Test Split: Data was split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
Target Variable: The target variable (Any_Failure) is binary, indicating the occurrence of any machine failure.
Evaluation Metrics: Models were evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Model Performance Summary
Model	Accuracy	Precision	Recall	F1-Score
Random Forest	0.965	0.47	0.68	0.56
Gradient Boosting	0.938	0.32	0.78	0.45
XGBoost	0.978	0.64	0.72	0.68
AdaBoost	0.904	0.22	0.75	0.34
Logistic Regression	0.705	0.07	0.63	0.12
The XGBoost model achieved the highest accuracy and balanced precision and recall, making it the best model for this task.

Results and Evaluation
The XGBoost model’s performance metrics demonstrate its effectiveness in predicting machine failures:

Accuracy: 97.8%
Precision: 0.64
Recall: 0.72
F1 Score: 0.68
Key Findings
The XGBoost model was further optimized through threshold tuning, increasing recall to capture more true positives while maintaining high precision.
Our results show that predictive maintenance models can substantially reduce unexpected downtimes, optimize resource allocation, and improve maintenance scheduling.
Conclusion
The predictive maintenance model developed in this project shows strong potential for real-world applications, especially in industrial and manufacturing settings. The XGBoost model is particularly effective in anticipating machine failures, providing valuable insights for preventive maintenance strategies.

Key Takeaways
Proactive Maintenance: Effective identification of potential failures before they escalate into costly downtimes.
Resource Optimization: Efficient scheduling and resource allocation, ultimately reducing unnecessary maintenance costs.
Future Work: Further improvements could include real-time data integration, IoT deployment, and continuous model retraining for adaptive maintenance systems.
